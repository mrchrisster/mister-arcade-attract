# Attract_Arcade-mrchrisster.ini

Customized ini for my setup: CRT, 60HZ NTSC, S-Video adapter, only horizontal. 
I'm using Antonio Villena's S-Video adapter and some cores like Mario Bros. show weird colors so I disabled them. Other cores like Asteroids are vector so I had to disable them as well.
To use this ini instead of the default, rename to Attract_Arcade.ini
