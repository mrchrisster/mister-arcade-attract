# Attract_Arcade-mrchrisster.ini

Customized ini for my setup: CRT, 60hz NTSC, S-Video adapter, only horizontal. 

I'm using Antonio Villena's S-Video adapter and some cores don't display well on my particular setup, like Mario Bros. (shows weird colors), Asteroids (vector) and Moon Patrol (not 60hz) so I disabled them. Your list might be different from mine so I encourage you to delete the cores off the exclusion list that work for you.

To use this ini instead of the default, rename to Attract_Arcade.ini
