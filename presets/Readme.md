# Attract_Arcade-mrchrisster.ini

Customized ini for my setup: CRT, 60HZ NTSC, S-Video adapter, only horizontal. 

I'm using Antonio Villena's S-Video adapter and some cores like Mario Bros. (shows weird colors), Asteroids (vector) and Moon Patrol (not 60hz) so I disabled them. Your list might be different than mine so I encourage you to delete the cores off the excludion list that work for you.

To use this ini instead of the default, rename to Attract_Arcade.ini
