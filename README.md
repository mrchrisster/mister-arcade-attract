# Mister Arcade Attract Mode
This script starts a random Arcade game from your collection every 2 minutes. You can play the game during that time, but it will automatically switch to a new game after 2 mins. When you're done, simply reboot your MiSTer from the OSD (F12) menu - or use the power button!

# Usage
To cycle through all MiSTer Arcade cores, copy Attract_Arcade.sh to /media/fat/Scripts Directory:

## Custom List
To use a custom list of arcade games to play create /media/fat/Scripts/Attract_Arcade.txt with 1 MRA file - including extension - per line.

## Horizontal or Vertical Only
For a curated list of only horizontal or vertical Arcade Games chosen because they have great looking Attract Screens copy:
* Attract_Arcade_Horiz.sh
or
* Attract_Arcade_Vert.sh

Make sure you have your Arcade roms setup correctly. [Update-all](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer) script works great for that.
